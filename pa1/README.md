# PA1

## Overview

PA1 is intended to test our understanding of syscalls like fork() and exec(). 

The album program that is produced takes in a photo or a directory of photos and asks the user for captions and if they want to rotate the picture or not. After the last photo is processed, the program will then generate a simple index.html file containing the photos

It uses the readline.c helper program provided by Travis to read in user input safely. 

### How to run

After compiling the program using the provided makefile you can run it on the commandline using:

`./album (path to file)`

It will then tell you how many photos are being processed. Follow the directions that are printed out exactly, and you will be fine!
